## Overview

The Exposure Visualization Tool is a GUI application used to view the details and results of mobile contact-tracing testing with Exposure Notification (EN) apps. The scenarios visualized involve multiple agents (phone-carriers) in a scene with EN enabled on their phone, after which a "sick" agent shares its status and an alert of exposure may be received by the other agents. This tool was created to analyze and present EN data collected by the MITLL-PACT team in collaboration with the University of Arizona. A formatted version of this data is provided in the `MITLL-UA` folder and can be viewed with this tool or used as a template for custom data. Some data files including the phone "dumpsys" logs are reduced to contain only the relevant data for this application.

### Features
- **Information panel**: Provides information on the test, "sick" and selected agents and their respective phones, including distance, phone hardware, phone placement, and exposure level. 
- **2D scene viewer**: Displays a top-down representation of the test environment and agent placements. Agents are color-coded based on the level of exposure reported by their phone, or if designated as the "sick" agent. The user can slide the simulated test time forward or backward to adjust the placement of moving agents.
- **Attenuation graph**: Shows both the average and range of signal attenuation received by the selected phone from the sick phone as a function of time, as well as attenuation threshold boundaries and the current simulated test time.

## Dependencies

Python 3.6 or greater is recommended.

Install the appropriate versions of [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing.html), [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/), and [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) for your version of python:

	$ pip install matplotlib numpy pygame

## Usage

### To run the MITLL-UA Dataset (from the root folder):

	$ python scripts/exposure_viz.py MITLL-UA/

### To run custom data:

	$ python scripts/exposure_viz.py [ROOT_DATA_PATH]
	
***Note**: For custom data, modification to variables or functions may be needed.* 

### Instructions:

- Run the Exposure Visualization tool from the command-line
- From the top bar, click on a tab to view the tests for that scenario
- Use letter keys (A-Z) to select agents by their letter ID
- Use the right arrow to move forward in time, and the left arrow to move backward in time
- Check the command-line terminal for status messages
- Scenarios using motion-capture data (such as `LargeParty`) will take longer to load

### Agent Color Key:

- Gray: no alert
- Yellow: low alert
- Red: high alert
- Green: "sick"
- Green (region): within 6 feet of "sick" phone
- Teal: default, alert type not recognized
